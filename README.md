## Quantum Low-Density Parity Check (QLDPC) Codes
* Work on simulating the construction of hypergraph product, homological product, and semi-topological product quantum error correcting (QEC) codes
* These codes are members of a larger class of "asymptotically-good" QLDPC codes and admit a variety of mathematically-inspired constructions. 
  * "asymptotically-good" is defined in terms of the **encoding rate** and **distance** of a code.
  * For such QLDPC codes...
    * the **encoding rate**, or the number of logical qubits encoded for every physical qubit, scales as a constant in the system size (number of physical qubits)
    * the **code distance**, or the threshold of the size of error a QEC code can correct, scales linearly in the system size.
